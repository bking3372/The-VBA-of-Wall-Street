# The VBA of Wall Street

### Objective:  Use VBA scripting to analyze stock market data.

**Step 1:**  A script was created to loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following:
  -  the ticker symbol
  -  the yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  -  the percent change from the opening price at the beginning of a give year to the closing price at the end of that year
  -  the total volume of the stock
  
  Conditional formatting was applied to highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red.
  
**Step 2:**  For each year, the following stocks are shown:
  -  the stock with the greatest percent increase
  -  the stock with the greatest percent decrease
  -  the stock with the greatest total volume.


The VBA script runs on every worksheet with one click.
