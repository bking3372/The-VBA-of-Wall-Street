# The VBA of Wall Street

Objective:  Use VBA scripting to analyze stock market data.

Step1:  Create a script to loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following:
  -  the ticker symbol
  -  the yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year
  -  the percent change from the opening price at the beginning of a give year to the closing price at the end of that year
  -  the total volume of the stock
  
  Apply conditional formatting to highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red.
  
Step2:  For each year, return the stock with the greatest percent increase, the stock with the greatest percent decrease, and the stock with the greatest total volume.


The VBA script will run on every worksheet with one click.
